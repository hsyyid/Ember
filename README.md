# Ember
A multiplayer minigame framework built using the Sponge Minecraft server platform.

> Ember is slim. It only has the core functionality required to start creating minigames.
> The idea was to set out and create a framework which was minimal and just handled the
> tedious things that developers usually don't like to handle.

# Features

> Ember currently allows the developer to create custom arenas and minigames with ease.
> This includes the ability to serialize and deserialize objects simply and effectively.

> Please read the documentation on using Ember for more information.
